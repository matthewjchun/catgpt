# CatGPT

CatGPT is a cat-themed chatbot! Meow, meow!

## Usage

www.foobarpleasedontforgettoreplacethis.com

CatGPT responds to greetings, thanks, and goodbyes.

In addition, CatGPT can give you:

- cat jokes!
- cat facts!
- summaries of specific cat breeds!

All you have to do is ask!

### Examples

- "Hello!"
- "Goodbye!"
- "Thank you!"
- "Tell me a cat joke"
- "I want a cat fact"
- "What can you tell me about the Ragdoll cat?"

## How?

CatGPT is made possible by using Cohere's Intent Recognition.

The model is trained on example data of each intent. User input is categorized into pre-defined intents through Cohere and based on the intent, a pre-defined response is displayed.

## Why not use text generation?

Cohere does have text generation, but users can ask it anything - whether or not it's related to cats. (Also, its jokes aren't great.)
