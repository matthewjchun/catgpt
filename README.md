# CatGPT

CatGPT is a cat-themed chatbot!

## Usage

www.foobarpleasedontforgettoreplacethis.com

CatGPT responds to greetings, thank you messages, and goodbyes.

In addition, CatGPT can give:

- cat jokes!
- cat facts!
- summaries of specific cat breeds!

## How?

CatGPT is made possible by using Cohere's Intent Recognition.

User input is categorized into pre-defined intents
The model is trained on example data of each intent
Based on the intent, a pre-defined response is displayed

## Why not use text generation?

Cohere does have text generation, but users can ask it anything - whether or not it's related to cats.
(Also, its jokes aren't great.)
